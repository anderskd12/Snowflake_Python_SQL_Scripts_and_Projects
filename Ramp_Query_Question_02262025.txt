-- This a script for showing the work behind a question on an application that I am applying for.


-- I loaded data in Snowflake using the scripts provided.
-- Once the data was loaded, I created a view to sum the data by day.  Then used the OVER function to create the three day moving average.  To have the query return one specific day, I added a common table expression to filter for the one day needed.  See below for details.

-- Create view on source data
create view vtran as 
SELECT TO_DATE(transaction_time) tran_date, SUM(transaction_amount) tran_amount FROM TRANSACTIONS GROUP BY TO_DATE(transaction_time)
ORDER BY 1 

-- Select query to calc moving average
SELECT 
    tran_date,
    tran_amount,
    AVG(tran_amount) OVER (
        ORDER BY tran_date 
        ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS three_day_avg
FROM vtran;

-- CTE to return the one day, the view has the full set of days to make the calculations work
WITH CTE_TRAN_DATE AS 
    (SELECT 
        tran_date,
        tran_amount,
        AVG(tran_amount) OVER (
            ORDER BY tran_date 
            ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) AS three_day_avg
    FROM vtran)
SELECT * FROM CTE_TRAN_DATE WHERE TRAN_DATE = '2021-01-31'
